## Hi there 👋
I am a second-year computer science student with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, particularly in computer vision. Since the popularisation of deep learning in 2011, I have been fascinated by how AI has been at the forefront of technological development, breaking perceptions of what was once thought impossible for computers in this day and age. 
My main goal is to grow alongside advancements in AI by developing a strong foundation and deep knowledge of this rapidly evolving and diverse field.


🔭 I’m currently working on 
    • Implementing deep learning techniques using TensorFlow
    • Developing a full-stack application with React, Django, HTML, and CSS
    • Building computer vision projects using OpenCV
    • Designing and training a YOLO-based object detection model
    and many others
